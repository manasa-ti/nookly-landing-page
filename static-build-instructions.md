# Static Website Build Instructions

## Overview
Your Nookly website has been converted to a static-only version, perfect for hosting on GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or any static hosting service.

## What Changed
- âœ… Removed server dependencies (Express, database)
- âœ… Updated forms to work without backend
- âœ… Used real app screenshot in hero section
- âœ… Updated color scheme to match #2D4B8A
- âœ… Added contact section with static form
- âœ… Added newsletter signup (saves to localStorage)

## Forms Functionality
- **Contact Form**: Opens user's default email client with pre-filled message
- **Newsletter**: Saves email to browser localStorage (basic tracking)
